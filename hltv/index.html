            <p>My journey with video games began at a very young age, around seven, when I got my first NES console, which I shared with my sister. We spent countless hours laughing and challenging each other, as well as playing with friends. Years later, I discovered Counter-Strike in its early versions (1.3) alongside my childhood best friend on the computer. I was introduced to a whole new world where I could play with multiple players at the same time, competing to showcase our skills.</p>
            <p>Eventually, I started participating in local tournaments, which required me to refine my character, discipline, strategic mindset, interpersonal skills, teamwork, and much more. I even developed leadership skills by becoming the team captain. This is why I decided to create this site dedicated to the competitive world of Counter-Strike.</p>

                <p>Video games require practice and dedication to improve. This commitment helps players develop discipline and set clear goals. Additionally, by gaming with people from different countries, young players have the opportunity to practice other languages in a fun and engaging environment.
